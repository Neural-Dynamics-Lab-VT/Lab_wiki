# Streaming data from BrainAmp Series amplifier

# Content description


## BrainAmp

This software allows the data coming from the EEG setup to be streamed in a local
network.

Follow these steps:

1. Make sure you are able to view the EEG signals using Recorder. 
Follow step from [here](https://github.com/Neural-Dynamics-Lab-VT/Lab_wiki/blob/master/Brain%20Vision%20Setup.md)
if you have problems.

2. Now, **Stop** monitoring the EEG signals on recoder. As of this writing 
Brain Vision does not allow to both stream and view EEG signals at the 
same time.

3. Enable Remote Data Access (RDA) on the machine that has the Recoder 
software installed (Server). To do this on Recoder: Preferences -> 
Remote Data Access.

4. Now open the BrainAmpSeries App and continue.

5.
